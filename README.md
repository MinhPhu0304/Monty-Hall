# Monty-Hall
Based on a famous game show called "Let's make a a deal"


**Notes:**
  * This program is only run on Window so Mac or Linux will not work
  * The program used Window GUI frame work in C++ so it added a lot of noises in the header file.
  * If you just want the program without looking at the source code you can go to here [Execudate file](https://github.com/MinhPhu0304/Monty-Hall/blob/master/Monty%20Hall%20GUI/Debug/Monty%20Hall%20GUI.exe) then click view Raw to download

I have not thought anything new about this game so I think it is a "finish" progam.
